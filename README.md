## Introduction
Learning to clean data using PostgreSQL

## Background
Determined to learn how to clean raw data, this project will show my understandings on how to clean up raw data to be easier to read.

### What I Was Trying to Achieve
1. Remove duplicate data
2. Standardize the data
3. Deal with Null values and blank data
4. Remove any un-needed data
